# emission-tracker

Emission Tracker is an app to see the CO2 emissions of a given country in history, and compare it to the population. The app includes a simple UI for searching countries and showing their CO2 emissions and populations in a graph. The app can be found from:

https://aapzu-emission-tracker.herokuapp.com/

### **NB**: 
When trying out the app please keep in mind that the API and the UI are deployed into different Heroku instances meaning that when the page is loaded it might take some seconds and refreshes before the actual data can be fetched and shown.
