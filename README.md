# reaktor-2019

This is the coding exercise required for Reaktor's recruiment in 2019. The app includes a simple UI for searching countries and showing their CO2 emissions and populations in a graph. The app can be found from:

https://reaktor-aapzu-2019.herokuapp.com/

### **NB**: 
When trying out the app please keep in mind that the API and the UI are deployed into different Heroku instances meaning that when the page is loaded it might take some seconds and refreshes before the actual data can be fetched and shown.

This repository only combines the UI and API of the app. The actual source code can be found from:
  - API: https://github.com/aapzu/reaktor-2019-server
  - UI: https://github.com/aapzu/reaktor-2019-ui
  
## How to
Better instructions can be found from the actual source repositories. But if you want to clone them both and use the app via this repo you can run:
 - `git clone git@github.com/aapzu/reaktor-2019`
 - `git submodule init`
